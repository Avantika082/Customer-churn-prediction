# Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to retain valuable customers and reduce revenue loss. This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze customer behavior and predict the likelihood of churn.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a telecom dataset to predict whether a customer is likely to churn. The workflow includes:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Model training and evaluation
* Model performance visualization

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is sourced from [Kaggle’s Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn), containing information about customer demographics, account information, and services subscribed.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 🧪 Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Avantika082/Customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd Customer-churn-prediction
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

   You can use pip to install dependencies:
